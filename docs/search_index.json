It has sinced been updated for multiple workshops at the Society for Epidemiology Research Annual Meeting, and as a workshop at the Institute of Medicine at the University of Gothenburg (Göteborg). The workbook was compiled by Marynia Kolak, co-facilitated with Qinyun Lin, with past support from Susan Paykin when HEROP was at the University of Chicago. Some coding snippets &amp; data examples are from the phenomenal team of the Opioid Environment Toolkit (Moksha Menghaney, Qinyun Lin, Angela Li). The overall approach follows the Center for Spatial Data Science UChicago paradigm, led by Luc Anselin &amp; Julia Koschinsky. Commitment This workbook is a 3-4 hour, fast-paced overview of mapping, GIScience, and spatial analysis basics for health professionals. When including extensive live coding, support, and additional practice in-person or at home on your own, it can be extended to a week-long program at minimum. You are encouraged to update with your own data finds after each example. Environment Setup A basic understanding of R is assumed. This workshop requires several packages, which can be installed from CRAN: install.packages(&quot;sf&quot;, &quot;tmap&quot;, &quot;tidygeocoder&quot;) For Mac users, check out https://github.com/r-spatial/sf for additional tips if you run into errors when installing the sf package. Using homebrew to install gdal usually fixes any remaining issues. "]]
